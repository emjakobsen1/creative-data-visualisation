### Deliverables of the day
This page contains all the daily deliverables I made during the project phase of Creative Data Visualization. 

During the first days, I had difficulties finding the right data set which led to a lot of deroutes. Working out and trying some different directions for the project, I realized a lot of potential problems that could arise due to scalability as these sets where huge. Some of these explorations can be seen here:

2. Coral reeves locations (x,y) and bleach level within the Indo-Pacific.

## Day 1:
<details>
- Describe your project focus - for example, “within the topic of deep time, our project focuses on xyz rocks and how they have changed over time in cyclical patterns”

2. Brainstorm possible focus points: 
    - What would be interesting to visualise about this topic?
    - What is fun or important or curious to discover around this topic?

    - What are your goals for your audience’s experience?
- Show your data - or tell us about what the data will be if you cannot find it yet.

Within the topic of systems, my project explores the coral reeves of the world based on the dataset at https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/773466. This data sets holds observations made between 1980 and 2019.

Corals are vulnerable and very sensitive to climate changes. A corals life depend on the algae inside it, and even minor changes in sea temperature, light, and nutrients will stress algae to leave the coral. Without the algae, the coral looses its major source of food and is more suspectiable to desease. This is called coral bleaching and makes the coral turn white. 

It would be interesting to visualize how various factors influence the life of corals, especially sea temperature caused by climate changes. 

The goal is to raise awareness of the impact of climate changes. The visualization should be easily accesable but still make the audience curious and encourage them to explore the data with an open mind set.
