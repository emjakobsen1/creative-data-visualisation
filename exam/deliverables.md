### Deliverables of the day
This page contains all the daily deliverables I made during the project phase of Creative Data Visualization. 

During the first days, I had difficulties finding the right data set which led to a lot of deroutes. Working out and trying some different directions for the project, I realized a lot of potential problems that could arise due to scalability as these sets where huge. Some of these explorations can be seen here:

1. Set of seedlings converted to SVG.
2. Coral reeves locations (x,y) and bleach level within the Indo-Pacific.

## Day 9:
<details>
- Describe your project focus - for example, “within the topic of deep time, our project focuses on xyz rocks and how they have changed over time in cyclical patterns”

2. Brainstorm possible focus points: 
    - What would be interesting to visualise about this topic?
    - What is fun or important or curious to discover around this topic?

    - What are your goals for your audience’s experience?
- Show your data - or tell us about what the data will be if you cannot find it yet.

</details>

Within the topic of systems, my project explores the coral reeves of the world based on the dataset at https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/773466. This data sets holds observations made between 1980 and 2019.

Corals are vulnerable and very sensitive to climate changes. A corals life depend on the algae inside it, and even minor changes in sea temperature, light, and nutrients will stress algae to leave the coral. Without the algae, the coral looses its major source of food and is more suspectiable to desease. This is called coral bleaching and makes the coral turn white. 

It would be interesting to visualize how various factors influence the life of corals, especially sea temperature caused by climate changes. 

The goal is to raise awareness of the impact of climate changes. The visualization should be easily accesable but still make the audience curious and encourage them to explore the data with an open mind set. 

## Day 10:

<details>
 Goal: Solidify plan to acquire dataset or create your dataset. Get to know your data. Write down patterns, ideas that come from getting to know the data.

### Expectations for the end of today -

Make a post on slack (or link to your own notebook) with the following:

1. Your dataset (or decided on which one you will use, or started collecting it)
2. You understand it (you know what each column and item of data means, what range it has, what type of data it is, what its patterns are)
3. Your vision of the final outcome of your data visualisation as a “headline of the future”, for example:

### If you need more guidance, follow the steps below:

## Part 1:

1. Get to know your data set:
    - What kind of data is this?
    - What are the patterns?
    - What are the surprises or outliers?
    - What are the minimums and maximums?
2. What questions do you hope to help your audience explore or answer when they see your visualisation?
3. Brainstorm: write down some themes or catchy titles you see in the data, angles that would be interesting to expose, or questions your data visualisation might help answer
4. Imagine, write sketch how you would visualise data to go with each theme, possibly find visual references for those visualisations
5. Present the themes to us when we gather together

### Deliverables:

- Post 1-2 catchy titles + subtitle of the visualisation you might make

## Part 2:

1. Choose 1 theme from what you presented and refine the data to focus on that theme
2. Isolate 3 rows of data and get to know them again:
    - Jot down a row of data - what types of data are you working with? Numbers? Words?
    - If numbers, what are the lowest numbers in the dataset? Highest? From one entry to the next, how do they move - tiny increments or big jumps?
    - Which data is the most crucial to your theme?
    - Which data is secondary?

### Deliverables:

- Your final chosen catchy title, refined data, isolated rows of data
- Double check: do you have the data to support these themes? If not, write down what
</details>

1. The set consists of both quantative and qualitative data. Data entries such as location (longitude, lattitude), percentage bleached and and coral depths being continuous quantiative, and data describing the corals and reef sites nominal qualitative. 

2. I hope the audience can get deeper knowledge of the corals and the effect that sea temperature causes on coral bleaching. The data visualization could answer the following questions:

- Where and when was the coral reef observed? 
- Has the coral changed between two different observations?
- Which factors such as wind level, turbidity and exposure was present during the observation?
- What is the overall status for coral reefs in the world, and based of the observations from 1980 to the present, can we say anything about the future of the corals?

3. Brainstorm of titles:
Corals, Palette of the Sea, Colors of the Deep, Coral Chronicles.

Final title: <strong>Colors of the Deep</strong> Subtitle: <strong>How the ocean's corals are bleaching </strong>.

## Day 11:

<details>
 Goal: Visual encoding

During your brainstorming phase, you should consider two things:

- The focusing question you want to answer with your visualisation
- The type of data you are visualising

## Part 1:

### Create moodboard

- Using images from art, nature, architecture, sciences (physics, biology, chemistry), can you find structures or styles that are similar to how you think about your data and theme? Gather them into a moodboard.

### Sketch

I suggest that you sketch by hand because it allows you to quickly show your ideas

- With your moodboard nearby, and 1 row of your data, sketch ideas for representing the data visually
    - Consider the architecture for the vis, based on your primary data - is it about time, so timeline based? Relationships of the data to each other?
    - What shapes could you use to represent the data? And how would the data form the shape? As in, the circle radius, or its placement on the x axis, etc.
    - What special marks would allow you to include more dimensions of the data? This would delineate “secondary” data pieces (the data that is not as important but you still want to include it)
    - [Check here for guidance](https://www.notion.so/References-68fc8499d7d04891b5527d89eb251851?pvs=21)
- Come up with at least 6 ideas or variations on ideas
- Precisely now, represent a few rows of your dataset in your ideas
- resent the ideas to the class when we gather together

### Deliverables

- Minimum 6 ideas and-or variations on ideas for visual encodings, presented as sketches
- Moodboard
  
</details>

Getting a grasp of the data in the set, along with 5 brainstorm sketches ispired by the moodboard.
