          <strong>Coral reefs are some of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth. Scientists estimate that 25 percent of all marine species live in and around coral reefs, making them one of the most diverse habitats in the world. Despite their great value, coral reefs are some of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet. </strong>
        </p> 
          <p>Thermal-stress events associated with climate change cause coral bleaching and mortality that threatens coral reefs. Yet coral bleaching and coral
            cover patterns vary spatially. A novel approach is to identify outliers—places, where ecosystems are substantially better or worse than expected, given the environmental conditions and socioeconomic drivers they are exposed to. These <em>bright spots</em> as opposed to dark sports, are characterized by high coral cover and low percentage of coral bleach and is where corals have the potential to survive through climate change. </p>
        <p>Coral cover and coral bleach is affected by a variety of many factors. While high levels of human engagement in management and maintenance has proven to be beneficial, Shannon Elizabeth Sully's recent research project explores the many environmental variables affecting the corals, ultimately suggesting the environmental characteristics of coral bright and dark spots.   </p>
      <p><em>Latitude</em> was found to be a positively associated with coral cover and bleach. Coral reefs residing between -15 and 15 degrees was more likely to survive climate change. <em>Sully's</em> study suggests that this is due to a higher diversity of the coral's species composition, and that these corals adapt more easily to thermal stress because of consistently warmer temperatures being closer to equator. </p>
      <p><em>The standard deviation of thermal stress anomaly frequencies</em> describes the standard deviation of the number of times over previous 52 weeks that thermal stress anomalies where larger or equal to 1 °C. A higher standard deviation was also positively associated with coral bleach. </p>
      <p><em>Turbidity</em>, is a measure of the water's clarity in which the coral live. The study also identified a turbidity range (0.080–0.127 Kd490) at which incoming light is reduced enough to limit photoinhibition but not so much that the corals have insufficient light.</p>    
    <p>
      <strong>This visualization attempts to illustrate potential bright spots</strong>. Each circle is a coral, and the y-axis represents the corals distance to equator in latitude degrees. The corals between -15 and 15 degrees appear to have higher coral cover (bigger) and less coral bleach (color opacity) which indicates bright spots, while the corals between 15 and 20 and -15 and -20 indicate dark spots. The x-axis represents the standard deviation of thermal stress anomaly frequencies, suggesting healthier corals as we approach 0.  </p>
    <p>Examples of specific bright spot locations include New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, the Sulu Sea, Northern Sulawesi and eastern Indonesia and French Polynesia. Specific dark spot locations include eastern Africa and northwestern Madagascar, the Marshall Islands and the northern Caribbean. Given their increased likelihood of persisting into the future, these climate change refugia and bright spots may be important targets for conservation funding and efforts in the future.</p>
